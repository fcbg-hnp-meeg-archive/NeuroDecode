# Introduction

**NeuroDecode** provides a real-time brain signal decoding framework. 

[Deprecated] The decoding framework was designed for a motor-imagery project. 
Modern decoding libraries should be used for the decoding aspects: [braindecode](https://github.com/braindecode/braindecode), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [tensorflow and keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
The enhanced LabStreamingLayer capabilities are improved and maintained in [BSL](https://github.com/fcbg-hnp-meeg/bsl).
